# EEE4022 Reseacrh project
- The following are various approaches to modelling the pendulum
- all attempt differ from each other by means of position definitions and angular velocity definitions, the other parts of the dynamics are consequences of the positions, hence the approach to finding the remaining dynamics are the same
## Spherical pendulum
- this approach uses spherical coordinates to define postions using angles $\theta_{1,2}, \phi_{1,2}$

## final version
- This approach defines the position of the pendulum in it's own frame and then uses the rotation matrix to find the position in the global frame
- This approach uses the rotation matrix to find the position in the global frame
