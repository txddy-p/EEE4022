## Spherical pendulum
- this was by far the best approach, because it takes a simple pendulum, puts it in 3D, adds a second pendulum in 3D as well using angles $\theta_1, \theta_2, \phi_1, \phi_2$
- adjusting these various angles can lead to various different scenarios

## Rot_Box pendulum
- this approach uses rotation matrices to good effect
- 3d plots seem to work

## Box pendulum
- this follows the pyomo tutorial, but I had a problem with putting it in 3D
